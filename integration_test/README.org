* Integration test in Flutter

Files in this directory which end with '_test.dart' are integration (drive) tests. 

See the "Testing in Flutter" heading in https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_experiments/blob/master/doc/flutter-notes.org for details of Dart unit test, Flutter widget test and Flutter integration test.

See https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction
  for integration testing in Flutter.

See https://dev.to/mjablecnik/take-screenshot-during-flutter-integration-tests-435k
  for how to take a screenshot from your Flutter app inside flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart;
  but the same should work from an actual flutter run --device_id app.dart
