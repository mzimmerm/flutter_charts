# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
#    pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
# publish_to: https://pub.dartlang.org # OR 'none' if no publishing.
# documentation: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_charts/doc

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# Example: version: 2.0.0+8
#   means : versionName=2.0.0, versionCode=8
#   processed this way : top/android/local.properties is generated with the above variables, then used in build.gradle
version: 0.5.2+8

# Without the "environment" section, we get message on

# 2024-02-22 : Flutter channel stable has: Flutter 3.19.1, Dart 3.3.0
# sdk means Dart sdk version.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # Self-host google fonts as assets require this section.
  # Using Google Fonts as assets requires the client download ("install") the font files stated in assets, 
  # google_fonts/Comforter-Regular.ttf in the font we chose.
  # Installing the fonts is needed in conjunction with setting `GoogleFonts.config.allowRuntimeFetching = false;`
  # in main.dart.
  # These 2 items (installing fonts and setting the configuration), are needed ONLY in integration tests. 
  # App works without those 2 additions.
  # However, be aware that the default `GoogleFonts.config.allowRuntimeFetching = true;`
  # potentially violates Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), because the user's IP address
  # is exposed outside Europe. That is another reason to self-host (download) the fonts. 
  fonts:
    - family: 'Comforter'
      fonts:
        - asset: google_fonts/Comforter-Regular.ttf

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section here, in
  # this "flutter" section, as in:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # To add assets from package dependencies, first ensure the asset
  # is in the lib/ directory of the dependency. Then,
  # refer to the asset with a path prefixed with
  # `packages/PACKAGE_NAME/`. Note: the `lib/` is implied, do not
  # include `lib/` in the asset path.
  #
  # Here is an example:
  #
  # assets:
  #  - packages/PACKAGE_NAME/path/to/asset

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
