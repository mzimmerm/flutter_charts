** TODO Stack overflow: add question on how to migrate int extensions - note in gitter

// todo-10 mz ori

Converting some code to 2.0 .. How can one tear-off a specifically typed function in 2.0? My problem is for example:

`_values.reduce(math.min)`

If _values were double in version 1.0x, this is ok. In 2.0 I get:

`type '(num, num) => num' is not a subtype of type '(double, double) => double' of 'combine'`

Here , `combine` I assume is a method in `reduce`. It is probably obvious but eluding me. Thanks.


Emulator: 
- v 24: works.
- v 25: fails loading!!!


@RandalSchwartz : Thanks, that is interesting. I will google for it. Although I am confused what num.max going away would mean, that num also goes away?  `math.max` is defined as:

`external T max<T extends num>(T a, T b);`

It sounds like in the end this is just a type system complaint, I hope we should be able to use a list of num and then do a concrete operations on them, at least if they are all the same type (int or double, which they are) in the data I passed.

* IN-PROGRESS Flutter Charts Bugs status

- [X] Chart area needs clipping in the application
- [ ] The stock charts example contains a bug which reverts the series on the negative values - both negative dataRows, and dataRowsColors must be reverted for the chart stacks to show in intended order (black, green grey red from top). But even then, dataRowsLegends are incorrect. 
- [X] https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/issues/5 - Coloring support: Make line chart dot colors settable


* IN-PROGRESS New release may 2018 todo-now finish this and remove section

- [X] Test if works
- [X] charts, try to set on input, mix of double and int, test if works - create a sample input for it
- [X] finish charts - last todo-4, leave -5 for immediate 
- [X] implement or remove todos
- [X] -3, -4, -5 ... change the once I want to keep to -10
- [X] look over 00, maybe change to -1
- [X] only keep -1 -2. -3 will become high priority
- [X] rename -10 to -3
- [X] Put Legend back - figure out why the stress causes exception - allow silently remove the legend.
- [X] add section to charts readme on how to create and run  tests (position of file, what to add to pubspec.yaml, run: 'flutter test' - that is all. Note: also append https://flutter.io/testing/
- [X] add ability to expose IncrementalLayouter
- [X] add to readme:
  - [X] changes to latest version, screenshots of gradual constraining
- [X] run analyser, make sure it runs
- [ ] make sure example exists on pub.dartlang.org
- [ ] test charts
- [ ] test charts within flutter_charts_sample_app
- [ ] release new version
  - [ ] follow steps in the Pub - Publish section
- [ ] test charts within flutter_charts_sample_app

* How are todos used in code
- todo-1 long term low priority
- todo-2 long term higher priority
- todo-10 release-blocker (created typically during a new work in progress)
- todo-11, -12 etc - work in progress, higher number is higher priority or more immediate

* NOTE Adding images to README.org

*Images are not allowed on pub  https://pub.dartlang.org. When new images are added to README, we need to put the images somewhere outside pub, README.md must only contain links to the images. We decided to store images in a special directory doc/readme_images, and point to then via github*. 

This is the process of adding images to README.org, which survives conversion to README.md, and publishing on pub:

- [ ] Add an image to README.org using the regular image capture.
- [ ] Show the image links directly
- [ ] Rename the images to a readable names, both on disk (wdir-) and in org file, for example: =README.org_20180618_000741_0oAyud.png= to =README.org_iterative-layout-step-4.png=
- [ ] Move the image to flutter_charts ~doc/readme_images~
- [ ] Change the links in org file by changing =file:= to =file:doc/readme_images/=
  - [ ] org file, look like =file:doc/readme_images/README.org_iterative-layout-step-4.png=


* NOTE Pub - Publish : Workflow of publishing new version on flutter_charts on https://pub.dartlang.org
** ~cd flutter_charts; flutter packages upgrade~
** Test app from IntelliJ

** Run ~flutter test~. Also see  https://flutter.io/testing/
** Notes:
*** Pub requires the following file in project to show the correct tabs on pub
**** Tab README.md    - Needs the file
**** Tab CHANGELOG.md - Needs the file
**** Tab Example      - this tab appears if the project file ~file:flutter_charts/example/lib/main.dart~ exists
**** Tab Installing   - shows automatically
** IF *README.md* needs change
*** *README.org*: ! *make sure image links point to flutter_charts ~/doc/readme_images~ as, for example:* [ [ file:doc/readme_images/README.org_IMGID.png ] ]
*** *README.org*: Conversion steps to *README.md* 

To convert *README.org* to *README.md*, we need to do a few extra steps for README.md image links to be readable on https://pub.dartlang.org.

1. Note: Ensure README.org file which has the "Table of contents" heading marked as :TOC:noexport: (e.d. Contents :TOC:noexport:) - this causes the TOC update on every save.
   - The :noexport: is currently needed , otherwise error Unable to resolve link: "link-converted-from-first-heading"
2. *README.org*: Export org to md: ~C-c C-e m m~ in the org file to create the generated md file
3. *README.md*: Delete generated TOC, the whole section named "# Table of Contents" (still needed with :TOC:noexport:)
4. *README.md*: Generate md-native TOC:
5. Cursor on top
6. ~M-x: markdown-toc-generate-toc~
7. *README.md*: Fix image links in the README.md - links must look like this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC markdown
  -![img](doc/readme_images/README.org_20171102_180657_27063rZs.png)
  +![img](https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/raw/master/doc/readme_images/README.org_20171102_180657_27063rZs.png)
  #+END_SRC
   - *README.md*: This is achieved with: ~M-x replace-string~ then ~doc/readme_images/~ ~https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/raw/master/doc/readme_images/~
** *pubspec.yaml*: - Increase version number "version: 0.1.8"
** *CHANGELOG.md*: - Add comment section for new version
** ~git add .; git commit; git push~
** *README.md*: on https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts - check if image links have a full path
** ~flutter packages pub publish --dry-run~
** ~flutter packages pub publish~
** Check https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_charts
** Test the package that was just published
*** ~cd flutter_charts_sample_app; flutter packages pub upgrade; flutter packages pub get; flutter run~

* DONE Add ability to create a Table of Contents to README.org
- [X] Install toc-org package
- [X] Add to init.el
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(if (require 'toc-org nil t)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'toc-org-enable)
(warn "toc-org not found"))
#+END_SRC
- [X] Every time README.org is saved, first heading with a :TOC: tag will be updated with the current table of contents.
- [X] So nothing special need be done after the above is configured.
 
* TODO Enhancements todo

** Refactorings
*** Introduce Mixin Layoutable by applyParentOffset()
*** Introduce Mixin Paintable by paint()
** Enhancements in progress or planned - priority order

*** Create a document / image showing chart layout and spacing - show option variables on image
Also:
- document applyParentOffset and pull from Container?
- go over Container and document

*** Add org mode based integration build, which allows to run and test all "known/predefined" code scenarios that work. 
*** To the above org mode base integration build, add ability to "capture self", and compare result as jpeg/svg with known jpeg/svg results
*** Add formatter for YLabels.
*** Option additions that control look:
**** Add options to hide the grid (keep axes)
**** Add options to hide  axes (if axes not shown, labels should not show?)
**** Decrease option for default spacing around the Y axis.
*** Provide tooltip support
*** Provide a few more chart types: Spline line chart (stacked line chart), Grouped VerticalBar chart,
.
*** Data types
**** Independent (X value) data types
***** There should be adapters from any dependent (X value) data types:
****** Ordinal - x values spaced evenly, only sequence matters
****** Measured - x values are convertible to numbers
******* Date types
******* Number types
******* Others?
**** Dependent (Y value) data types - for now, keep double, can provide converters.

*** For ChartOptions.useUserProvidedYLabels = true. See example with User defined YLabels: Current implementation sets the minimum of dataRows range (1.0 in the example) on the level of the first Y Label ("Ok" in this example), and the maximum  of dataRows range (10.0 in this example) on the level of the last Y Label ("High" in this example). This is not desirable, we need to add a userProvidedYLabelsBoundaryMin/Max.
*** Next, add ability to invert X and Y axis (values on horizontal axis)
*** TextPainter notes

If layout() is called, following paint() always prints full line  (goes to line 2 if the text contains LF).
* DONE Enhancements implemented
** DONE Re-implement the layout more generically and clearly. Space saving changes such as /tilting/ labels
** DONE Labels auto-fit: scale, tilt or skip labels to fit using *HorizontalLabelsContainer*

* Terminology and Selected Classes

- (Presenter)Leaf       :: The finest visual element presented in each  "column of view" in chart - that is, all widgets representing series of data displayed above each X label. For example, for Line chart, the leaf would be one line and dot representing one Y value at one X label. For the bar chart, the leaf would be one bar representing one (stacked) Y value at one X label.
- Classes: Presenter, LineAndHotspotPresenter, VerticalBarPresenter, PresenterCreator
- Painter               :: Class which paints to chart to canvas. Terminology and class structure taken from Flutter's Painter and Painting classes.
- Classes: todo

* Older Notes

** Towards a new, suggested ~InternalChartData~ class - this is the class Flutter Charts will work from at it's core. *This may change significantly.*

First, let me summarize that current (unexpressed) constraints on  the current ~ChartData.dataRows~ - in essence, all corresponding list lengths must be the same:

1) Along the x axis (row wise)   : (each row in dataRows).length is the same 
2) Along the x axis (row wise)   : (each row in dataRows).length == xLabels.length 
3) Along the y axis (series wise): dataRows.length == dataRowsColors.length == dataRowsLegends.length

Basically, the ~dataRows~ member assumed to be an array (list of rows of equal length)

So towards the future, the more I was thinking the way the layouting may work, the more I am sure it is best to keep 1) for sure, and maybe 3), but drop 2) for sure to support uneven steps and skipped labels. And in all case I kept arriving at thinking the layouter would eventually convert any ~List<List<Point>>~ to a list of Y values ~List<List<double>>~ and extract the X values under each point so we have List<double> xValues. I would like to note that this structure can be made in all respects equivalent to  ~List<List<Point>>~ - we can always write adaptors in either direction. 

So I'd like to support the internal structure of ChartData as described below, and all external data in different formats/structure would have to provide convertes; this project would probably provide some basic adaptors (I am thinkig to support some basic (e.g. some Higchart type) JSON data formats out of the box.

Next, goals and non-goals of this change.

*Current goals of the ~InternalChartData~ class:*

- Define a data source class used on the the low end of chart layout. 
- Define the data source class in terms of lowest level primitives: Because in the end, all paint operations operate only with Dart ~double~ (for Y values, and Distanced X points) and Dart ~String~, we only use those primitives.
- Still allow for a simple, no frills way of clients defining their own X and Y labels directly, similar to the current ~ChartData~ 
- Provide a sufficient description for data defined as any "reasonable" object to be convertable to  ~InternalChartData~ through adaptors.
  - Data Adaptor Examples: 
    - X values is a List<String>, Y values is a  List<double>      => ~InternalChartData~
    - X and Y values are an array, e.g. List<List<double>>         => ~InternalChartData~
    - X values is a List<DateTime>, Y values is a  List<double>    => ~InternalChartData~
- Provide a converter from ~ChartData~ to  ~InternalChartData~


*Current non-Goals of the ~InternalChartData~ class. These may become goals later*
- We can rephrase the simplification of ~double~ (both for X and Y ) in terms of interfaces that allow for *order* and *distance* : let us call them ~OrdinalDimension~ and ~DistancedDimension extends OrdinalDimension~. ~OrdinalDimension~ provides order of it's points,  ~DistancedDimension~ provides distance of it's points. Basically substitute ~double~ everywhere above and is the definition of ~InternalChartData~ with ~OrdinalDimension~ . *BUT I HAVE A TODO HOW TO DO THIS RIGHT*. 
  - ~double DistancedDimension.distance(DimensionPoint point, DimensionPoint point)~ // must satisfy distance properties
  - ~int OrdinalDimension.comparePoints(DimensionPoint point, DimensionPoint point)~
  - ~double DimensionPoint.toDouble()~ - basically, distance from origin on the chart. Required(?) to find a minimum, maximum; We require this for OrdinalDimension as well, where it duplicates order - basically the result is the sequence in a the list of ordered dimension points.


For now all members are public but that may change. Also will describe some constructors later.

Also, although "from a separation of data and view" principle I originally put some of the settings that define the chart "view" onto ChartOptions, I plan to move them to ChartData, and InternalChartData.

- [ ] ChartOptions.useUserProvidedYLabels -> ChartData
- [ ] ChartOptions.yLabelUnits -> ChartData
- [ ] ChartOptions.toLabel(label) -> ChartData
- 

** Refactoring todos

1) [ ] Now we manage rowIndex (seriesIndex) in StackableValuePoint as dataRowIndex. So:
   + Add rowIndex on Presenter (Leaf) as dataRowIndex.

   + [ ] remove rowIndex from everywhere - createPointPresenter (createPresentor) , _createPresentersInColumn - and when it is needed for color, just use the Presenter.dataRowIndex.

2) [ ] Split Function of vertGridLines- *vertGridLines[col].from.dx* serves both to draw grid lines, and ValuePoints. Add, right in XLayouterOutput, a variable for valuePointX - *what is the difference from labelX???*.

3) [ ] Redefine Points and Presenters internal structure, as (from the bottom) double-linked list of points (forms Columns), and double-linked list of Columns (forms PointsColumns = Data) and Presenters (PresentersColumns)

4) [ ] Member privacy issues

   + [ ] ChartPainter.layouter is forced non-private (_) if we want to allow extensibility outside of the chart package (extensibility by clients).
   + [ ] Go over usage of private accessing private _chartLayouter._options - suspect. But maybe ok

5) [ ] Think of a way to get rid of the need to upcast in baseclass using " as SomeClass" - 2 occurences in "presenter as presenters.PointAndLinePresenter"

6) [ ] I think yAxisAbsMin/Max passed to layouters is switched. Fix it

7) *REMOVE NOISE OF nextRightPointsColumn nextRightColumnValuePoint*

   1) [ ] *nextRightPointsColumn* IS LIKELY UNUSED, REMOVE but check.

   2) [ ] *nextRightColumnValuePoint*  IS LIKELY UNUSED, REMOVE but check.

8) [ ] Create a document definiting sequence of layouters, and what each does
   - [ ] particular attention to where scaling happents
9) [ ] *Legend improvements*

   1) [ ] Implement legend as container, with layout that can wrap.

10) [ ] Fix and test formalities, add docs, add examples, resolve versionning and library dependencies and branches, other preps before push to pub
    + [ ] Test and ensure empty data work.
    + [ ] *ADD TESTS FOR RANGE, END TO END ETC*
