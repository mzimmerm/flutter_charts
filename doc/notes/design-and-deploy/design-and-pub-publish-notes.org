* IN-PROGRESS Flutter Charts Bugs status

- [ ] After tons of layout changes, the whole grid disappeared from the line chart only.
- [ ] The stock charts example contains a bug which reverts the series on the negative values - both negative dataRows, and dataRowsColors must be reverted for the chart stacks to show in intended order (black, green grey red from top). But even then, dataRowsLegends are incorrect. 
- [X] Chart area needs clipping in the application
- [X] https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/issues/5 - Coloring support: Make line chart dot colors settable

* TODO Dart or Flutter bugs to report or ask on Stack Overflow

** TODO Stack overflow: add question on how to migrate int extensions - note in gitter

// todo-10 mz ori

Converting some code to 2.0 .. How can one tear-off a specifically typed function in 2.0? My problem is for example:

`_values.reduce(math.min)`

If _values were double in version 1.0x, this is ok. In 2.0 I get:

`type '(num, num) => num' is not a subtype of type '(double, double) => double' of 'combine'`

Here , `combine` I assume is a method in `reduce`. It is probably obvious but eluding me. Thanks.


Emulator: 
- v 24: works.
- v 25: fails loading!!!


@RandalSchwartz : Thanks, that is interesting. I will google for it. Although I am confused what num.max going away would mean, that num also goes away?  `math.max` is defined as:

`external T max<T extends num>(T a, T b);`

It sounds like in the end this is just a type system complaint, I hope we should be able to use a list of num and then do a concrete operations on them, at least if they are all the same type (int or double, which they are) in the data I passed. 

** TODO Flutter bugs: Report issue of TextPainter hangs on certain sizes with ellipses - three dots '...'  like this.

See file:./bug-text-painter-1.png
See file:./bug-text-painter-2.png
** TODO Dart questions running

- Is there a way to initialize a non-nullable list to size?


* IN-PROGRESS Flutter Charts Enhancements

** IN-PROGRESS Refactorings

*** DONE Move all painting from ChartPainter.paint to ChartContainer.paint

*** DONE ~Remove _paintYLabels and similar~, just replace with content of the method.

*** 
*** IN-PROGRESS ~LayoutExpansion: Refactor LayoutExpansion to SizeConstraint and clarify role of SizeConstraint~
**** DONE Study function of LayoutExpansion and remove the GrowDoNotFill, TryFill, definition, parameters, arguments, and passing down entirely.

- LayoutExpansion is actually a fake - it in facts holds on to the Container size before and after layout. Eventually, convert it to "layoutSize" field instead of the getter.


**** DONE LayoutExpansion: more study and cleanup - pass to layout instead of to Container constructor (required layoutExpansion)

I suspect, this is actually used as Container.preLayoutSize - sort of like preferredSize !!!!
- or maybe as layoutSize member that is settable, to bypass only getter getLayoutSize
  
Study it and comment, maybe rename and refactor.

Code review:

- [ ] Container._layouExpansion is ONLY set during construction, so should be doable to be final! 
- [ ] LayoutExpansion is now passed to layout as it functions basically as SizeConstraint!!
-



**** IN-PROGRESS LayoutExpansion and Containers: remove all _layoutSize from extensions of Container, and add it as member to Container, replacing getter layoutSize in preparation of moving all these basic elements related to layout to Container.

This should be possible, and in principle relatively simply.

- [X] Remove _layoutSize from specializations of Container
- [ ] Remove get layoutSize from specializations of Container 
- 
- [ ] Container layoutSize will need set and get. To set, add new private _debugLayoutSetCount. This will be interesting to know if the setter was called after initial set in layout
- 


// todo-00-last-last-layout-size-block-added : 


**** TODO Move Container.dart to it's own package containter_base.dart

- This may cause some trouble !!!

**** TODO ~LayoutExpansion  and Containers: cleanup core problem - Currently, we use LayoutExpansion both as Constraints (by passing to layout and holding on to it) as well as layoutSize (by doing things such as get layoutSize { return _layoutExpansion }~

See those 2 examples:

#+begin_src javascript
  ui.Size get layoutSize {
    return new ui.Size(_layoutExpansion.width, _layoutExpansion.height);
  }
#+end_src

#+begin_src javascript

  void layout(LayoutExpansion layoutExpansion) {
    _layoutExpansion = layoutExpansion;
    // ### 1. Prepare early, from dataRows, the stackable points managed
    //        in [pointsColumns], as [YContainer] needs to scale y values and
    //        create labels from the stacked points (if chart is stacked).
    setupPointsColumns();

    .. etc
    }

#+end_src

We need to solve this but may not be possible. As a start, we could say:

By passing layoutExpansion to layout, we are basically forcing child size on the child. So the passed layoutExpansion is immediately becoming layout size.

So try this and see what happend:

In all layout definitions, such as:

#+begin_src javascript

  void layout(LayoutExpansion layoutExpansion) {
    _layoutExpansion = layoutExpansion;
    .. etc
    }
#+end_src

change that to:

#+begin_src javascript

  void layout(LayoutExpansion layoutExpansion) {
    _layoutSize = layoutExpansion;
    .. etc
    }
#+end_src

and see what happens :)


**** TODO ~LayoutExpansion and Containers: Now when the layoutSize is holding the passed layoutExpansion, Remove from Container, all members and getters around layoutExpansion. We can add at most a getter later (Flutter RenderObject and RenderBox has get constraints)~

- This may prove hard due to how things work currently.
  
**** TODO Rename LayoutExpansion to FixedSizeConstraint extends (new class) SizeConstraint (SizeConstraint equivalent of BoxConstraints to distinguish from BoxConstraints)


**** TODO Rename offset to layoutOffset

***** TODO rename applyParentOffset to applyParentLayoutOffset

**** TODO Look into remaining usages of "ui.Size get layoutSize"

  
**** TODO Review use of chartArea on ChartContainer, see if it should be simply replaced with layoutSize !!!

- but express that ChartContainer layoutSize should never change, be final!


*** TODO ~Rename offset to layoutOffset~
*** TODO Make Containers a hierarchy - Everything is a container. Layout, Inset, etc are also containers. Containers are wrapped and only contain children, not layouts, or other loose containers.
**** TODO Add return Size to layout. This should return current Container.layoutSize . This is for the short term.
**** TODO Edit all calls to layout and return it

**** TODO ~Add SizeConstraint~

                                     
- [ ] Add size_constraint.dart -
  - SizeConstraint{ _maxSize = Size.infinity; SizeConstraint({maxSize:}); SizeConstraint.infinity: redirect to SizeConstraint(maxSize: Size.infinity};},
- [ ] In existing code, Pass SizeConstraint to each Container.layout({required SizeConstraint sizeConstraint})
- [ ] Add SizeConstraint field to Container, from constructor.


**** TODO ~Container class~ - make it a hierarchy:

Container is it's children, but it can rotate or be moved.

***** TODO Add members and methods to Container class

- [ ] Add hierarchy stuff
  - [ ] ~parent~ [on top member it should be Contaier.root (in ChartContainer)]
  - [ ] ~children~ should be just a List<Containers>
  - [ ] ~traverse()~ 
  - [ ] ~flatten()~ 
  - [ ] ~isUniqueName()~
  - [ ] ~isRoot()~
- [ ] Add Content management stuff
  - [ ] ~addChild(Container)~ - can never be root
  - [ ] ~name~ not null, required
- [ ] Add Constructors
  - [ ] ~Container.root~, configure as root
    - member ~name~ set in all constructors or defaults to random string, functions as unique key. later Ensure name unique in hierarchy. 
  - [ ] constructor from children by passing children: List<Container>
- [ ] Layout related stuff
  - [ ] add member ~sizeConstraint~ - NOT NOW, LATER - ONLY PASSED TO LAYOUT, NO NEED TO HOLD ON TO - But flutter holds on to constraints in RenderObject 
  - [ ] add member ~layoutSize~
  - [ ] keep member ~layoutOffset~
  - [ ] implement default method ~layout(SizeConstraint)~ - see [[Layouter general function]]
  - [ ] add abstract method ~calculateAndSetActualChildrenLayoutSizesAndOffsetsInSelf()~ # Calculates children's positions in self based on what the layout actually is
  - [ ] ~applyParentOffset~ removed (BUT KEEP AT FIRST) - replaced by calculateAndSetActualChildrenLayoutSizesAndOffsetsInSelf
    - applies offset on self (call super)

***** TODO How do we want the Containers function eventually?

- Generally, Containers lifecycle should be as follows.
  - Create Container Hierarchy. This is specific, but for Chart, we should just add containers we know od
    - create Root (ChartContainer)
    - add all children recursively 
  - Layout
    - called by root.layout(SizeConstraint)
    - side effects
      - set layoutSize on all members in hierarchy (currently not done)
      - set offset (applyParentOffset) on all members in hierarchy 
  - Paint 
  
*** TODO ~HUGE - establish hierarchy between current Containers children of ChartContainer~ 
*** TODO ~Convert ChartContainer.layout to use the new concepts - CONVERT ONLY ON THIS LEVEL, NOT CHILDREN~
**** TODO Move some code to calculateAndSetActualChildrenLayoutSizesAndOffsetsInSelf

Code between layout and applyParentOffset, like this:
#+begin_example
    xContainer.layout();

    ui.Size xContainerSize = xContainer.layoutSize;
    ui.Offset xContainerOffset = new ui.Offset(
        yContainerSize.width, chartArea.height - xContainerSize.height);
    xContainer.applyParentOffset(xContainerOffset);
#+end_example
shoudl be moved to a XContainerManualLayout(new layout class).calculateAndSetActualChildrenLayoutSizesAndOffsetsInSelf
**** TODO What else  - much more

*** TODO ~HUGE - establish hierarchy between rest of current Containers~ (NOT non-container classes like Presenters, PresentersColumn etc)

*** TODO ~Convert all Presenter, PointsColumn, PointsColumns etc  to Containers but keep the code structure the same~

  - They are set in constructors, which are created during layout() of parents
  - For example, VerticalBarPresener constructor, all values (that is offsets) are established in Contructory, NOT in layout!

**** TODO Rename Container.paint to Container.presentOn - we may need
**** TODO research which containers hold on parents and children
**** TODO Make containers a hierarchy
***** Add 'parent' and 'children' members
***** Add 'name' member to Container 
**** TODO Ensure code sets up the hierarchy correctly 
***** Study use of GridLinesContainer, XContainer etc, their membership 
**** TODO Put ChartOptions only on top Container (ChartContainer, may be there already
***** remove passing the ChartOptions down
***** access ChartOptions in Containers via the (get)root 
***** 
*** TODO Remove complexity around passing ChartOptions.
*** TODO ChartContainer: Keep the class, but convert to Container where possible in method arguments.

***** I think in most places, we use ChartContainer  ONLY to pass down ChartOptions. So analyze such uses and convert to Container where possible, and get Options via root.chartOptions.
*** TODO Study Morphs what else needs added!
*** TODO Rename Container into Morph
**** Add a list of children to Morph
**** Add name field to Morph 
** LATER Enhancements in progress or planned - priority order

*** Create a document / image showing chart layout and spacing - show option variables on image
Also:
- document applyParentOffset and pull from Container?
- go over Container and document

*** Add org mode based integration build, which allows to run and test all "known/predefined" code scenarios that work. 
*** To the above org mode base integration build, add ability to "capture self", and compare result as jpeg/svg with known jpeg/svg results
*** Add formatter for YLabels.
*** Option additions that control look:
**** Add options to hide the grid (keep axes)
**** Add options to hide  axes (if axes not shown, labels should not show?)
**** Decrease option for default spacing around the Y axis.
*** Provide tooltip support
*** Provide a few more chart types: Spline line chart (stacked line chart), Grouped VerticalBar chart,
.
*** Data types
**** Independent (X value) data types
***** There should be adapters from any dependent (X value) data types:
****** Ordinal - x values spaced evenly, only sequence matters
****** Measured - x values are convertible to numbers
******* Date types
******* Number types
******* Others?
**** Dependent (Y value) data types - for now, keep double, can provide converters.

*** For ChartOptions.useUserProvidedYLabels = true. See example with User defined YLabels: Current implementation sets the minimum of dataRows range (1.0 in the example) on the level of the first Y Label ("Ok" in this example), and the maximum  of dataRows range (10.0 in this example) on the level of the last Y Label ("High" in this example). This is not desirable, we need to add a userProvidedYLabelsBoundaryMin/Max.
*** Next, add ability to invert X and Y axis (values on horizontal axis)
*** TextPainter notes

If layout() is called, following paint() always prints full line  (goes to line 2 if the text contains LF).
** DONE Items, bugs, refactorings Implemented
*** DONE Re-implement the layout more generically and clearly. Space saving changes such as /tilting/ labels
*** DONE Labels austo-fit: scale, tilt or skip labels to fit using *HorizontalLabelsContainer*

* NOTE Layouter general function

*The one-pass layout method in a Container* (or in Layouter mixin if we put Layouter on Container) should work like this:

1. *SizeConstraint is passed down* to layout call.                                               parent context: ~Size childPreferredSize = child.layout(sizeConstraintDefinedByParent)~  <= side effect: child.size is set (=childPreferredSize) 
2. *PreferredSize is returned up* from layout and also stored on child (happens also in 1).               
3. Once we know all children sizes:
4. Parent decides, based on it's layout algorithm,
   the size and position to actually give to each child :                                    parent context: calculateAndSetActualChildrenLayoutSizesAndOffsetsInSelf() <= layoutSize effect: child.layoutSize [overrides previous value] and child.offset (within parent) [new value] is set on each child. this.layoutSize and this.offset is set on me (parent)
6. Step 4 includes *Parent sets actual layoutSize and position down on child*.


#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def layout(Size sizeConstraintFromParent):     # 1. sizeConstraints go down (as this is called in parent context)
    if this is leaf:
      this.layoutSize = calculate own layoutSize (may be e.g. size of rectangle if this is a rectangle) if not withit SizeConstraint, exception???
      return this.layoutSize                # 2. sizes go up
    else:
      for child in children:
        # All children are offered the full layoutSize of parent. If greedy, that is a problem 
        Size layoutSize = child.layout(constraintFromParent) # ignore return, we have it in side-effect
      calculateAndSetActualChildrenLayoutSizesAndOffsetsInSelf()
      return this.layoutSize ????


  # For example, for flow layout, each child is given the layoutSize it previously asked, and moved by predecessors layoutSizes.
  # !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this replaces applyParentOffset
  def calculateAndSetActualChildrenLayoutSizesAndOffsetsInSelf():
    Offset currentOffset = 0
    Size myLayoutSize = 0
    for child in children:
      child.layoutSize = child.layoutSize         # Size goes down - no change in one pass layout
      child.offset += currentOffset   # 3. Actual position goes down
      currentOffset += new Offset(child.layoutSize.width, 0) # just shift next child some more to the right.
      myLayoutSize = currentOffset + child.layoutSize
    this.layoutSize = myLayoutSize

* NOTE Adding images to README.org

*Images are not allowed on pub  https://pub.dartlang.org. When new images are added to README, we need to put the images somewhere outside pub, README.md must only contain links to the images. We decided to store images in a special directory doc/readme_images, and point to then via github*. 

This is the process of adding images to README.org, which survives conversion to README.md, and publishing on pub:

- [ ] Add an image to README.org using the regular image capture.
- [ ] Show the image links directly
- [ ] Rename the images to a readable names, both on disk (wdir-) and in org file, for example: =README.org_20180618_000741_0oAyud.png= to =README.org_iterative-layout-step-4.png=
- [ ] Move the image from ~flutter_charts~ to ~flutter_charts/doc/readme_images~
- [ ] Change the links in org file by changing =file:= to =file:doc/readme_images/=
  - [ ] in the org file, this look like =file:doc/readme_images/README.org_iterative-layout-step-4.png=

* DONE Add ability to create a Table of Contents to README.org
- [X] Install toc-org package
- [X] Add to init.el
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(if (require 'toc-org nil t)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'toc-org-enable)
(warn "toc-org not found"))
#+END_SRC
- [X] Every time README.org is saved, first heading with a :TOC: tag will be updated with the current table of contents.
- [X] So nothing special need be done after the above is configured.

* Terminology and Selected Classes

- (Presenter)Leaf       :: The finest visual element presented in each  "column of view" in chart - that is, all widgets representing series of data displayed above each X label. For example, for Line chart, the leaf would be one line and dot representing one Y value at one X label. For the bar chart, the leaf would be one bar representing one (stacked) Y value at one X label.
- Classes: Presenter, LineAndHotspotPresenter, VerticalBarPresenter, PresenterCreator
- Painter               :: Class which paints to chart to canvas. Terminology and class structure taken from Flutter's Painter and Painting classes.
- Classes: todo

* Older Design Notes

** Towards a new, suggested ~InternalChartData~ class - this is the class Flutter Charts will work from at it's core. *This may change significantly.*

First, let me summarize that current (unexpressed) constraints on  the current ~ChartData.dataRows~ - in essence, all corresponding list lengths must be the same:

1) Along the x axis (row wise)   : (each row in dataRows).length is the same 
2) Along the x axis (row wise)   : (each row in dataRows).length == xLabels.length 
3) Along the y axis (series wise): dataRows.length == dataRowsColors.length == dataRowsLegends.length

Basically, the ~dataRows~ member assumed to be an array (list of rows of equal length)

So towards the future, the more I was thinking the way the layouting may work, the more I am sure it is best to keep 1) for sure, and maybe 3), but drop 2) for sure to support uneven steps and skipped labels. And in all case I kept arriving at thinking the layouter would eventually convert any ~List<List<Point>>~ to a list of Y values ~List<List<double>>~ and extract the X values under each point so we have List<double> xValues. I would like to note that this structure can be made in all respects equivalent to  ~List<List<Point>>~ - we can always write adaptors in either direction. 

So I'd like to support the internal structure of ChartData as described below, and all external data in different formats/structure would have to provide convertes; this project would probably provide some basic adaptors (I am thinkig to support some basic (e.g. some Higchart type) JSON data formats out of the box.

Next, goals and non-goals of this change.

*Current goals of the ~InternalChartData~ class:*

- Define a data source class used on the the low end of chart layout. 
- Define the data source class in terms of lowest level primitives: Because in the end, all paint operations operate only with Dart ~double~ (for Y values, and Distanced X points) and Dart ~String~, we only use those primitives.
- Still allow for a simple, no frills way of clients defining their own X and Y labels directly, similar to the current ~ChartData~ 
- Provide a sufficient description for data defined as any "reasonable" object to be convertable to  ~InternalChartData~ through adaptors.
  - Data Adaptor Examples: 
    - X values is a List<String>, Y values is a  List<double>      => ~InternalChartData~
    - X and Y values are an array, e.g. List<List<double>>         => ~InternalChartData~
    - X values is a List<DateTime>, Y values is a  List<double>    => ~InternalChartData~
- Provide a converter from ~ChartData~ to  ~InternalChartData~


*Current non-Goals of the ~InternalChartData~ class. These may become goals later*
- We can rephrase the simplification of ~double~ (both for X and Y ) in terms of interfaces that allow for *order* and *distance* : let us call them ~OrdinalDimension~ and ~DistancedDimension extends OrdinalDimension~. ~OrdinalDimension~ provides order of it's points,  ~DistancedDimension~ provides distance of it's points. Basically substitute ~double~ everywhere above and is the definition of ~InternalChartData~ with ~OrdinalDimension~ . *BUT I HAVE A TODO HOW TO DO THIS RIGHT*. 
  - ~double DistancedDimension.distance(DimensionPoint point, DimensionPoint point)~ // must satisfy distance properties
  - ~int OrdinalDimension.comparePoints(DimensionPoint point, DimensionPoint point)~
  - ~double DimensionPoint.toDouble()~ - basically, distance from origin on the chart. Required(?) to find a minimum, maximum; We require this for OrdinalDimension as well, where it duplicates order - basically the result is the sequence in a the list of ordered dimension points.


For now all members are public but that may change. Also will describe some constructors later.

Also, although "from a separation of data and view" principle I originally put some of the settings that define the chart "view" onto ChartOptions, I plan to move them to ChartData, and InternalChartData.

- [ ] ChartOptions.useUserProvidedYLabels -> ChartData
- [ ] ChartOptions.yLabelUnits -> ChartData
- [ ] ChartOptions.toLabel(label) -> ChartData
- 

** Refactoring todos

1) [ ] Now we manage rowIndex (seriesIndex) in StackableValuePoint as dataRowIndex. So:
   + Add rowIndex on Presenter (Leaf) as dataRowIndex.

   + [ ] remove rowIndex from everywhere - createPointPresenter (createPresentor) , _createPresentersInColumn - and when it is needed for color, just use the Presenter.dataRowIndex.

2) [ ] Split Function of vertGridLines- *vertGridLines[col].from.dx* serves both to draw grid lines, and ValuePoints. Add, right in XLayouterOutput, a variable for valuePointX - *what is the difference from labelX???*.

3) [ ] Redefine Points and Presenters internal structure, as (from the bottom) double-linked list of points (forms Columns), and double-linked list of Columns (forms PointsColumns = Data) and Presenters (PresentersColumns)

4) [ ] Member privacy issues

   + [ ] ChartPainter.layouter is forced non-private (_) if we want to allow extensibility outside of the chart package (extensibility by clients).
   + [ ] Go over usage of private accessing private _chartLayouter._options - suspect. But maybe ok

5) [ ] Think of a way to get rid of the need to upcast in baseclass using " as SomeClass" - 2 occurences in "presenter as presenters.PointAndLinePresenter"

6) [ ] I think yAxisAbsMin/Max passed to layouters is switched. Fix it

7) *REMOVE NOISE OF nextRightPointsColumn nextRightColumnValuePoint*

   1) [ ] *nextRightPointsColumn* IS LIKELY UNUSED, REMOVE but check.

   2) [ ] *nextRightColumnValuePoint*  IS LIKELY UNUSED, REMOVE but check.

8) [ ] Create a document definiting sequence of layouters, and what each does
   - [ ] particular attention to where scaling happents
9) [ ] *Legend improvements*

   1) [ ] Implement legend as container, with layout that can wrap.

10) [ ] Fix and test formalities, add docs, add examples, resolve versionning and library dependencies and branches, other preps before push to pub
    + [ ] Test and ensure empty data work.
    + [ ] *ADD TESTS FOR RANGE, END TO END ETC*

** Consider Change naming conventions to WX, HY, CY, CX so all names are consistent 
   - whateverOWX (width along x axis    - when context is offset of some other element)
   - whateverOHY (height along y axis   - when context is offset of some other element)
   - whateverCX  (X coordinate  )       - if it is just a point
   - whateverCY  (Y coordinate  )       - if it is just a point
   - rare use below v
   - whateverRWX (width along x axis  - when context is rectangle)
   - whateverRHY (height along y axis  - when context is rectangle)
   - whateverFromCY (Y coordinate from ) - if it is a point which is part of a line
   - whateverToCY (Y coordinate to )     - if it is a point which is part of a line
   - whateverFromCX (Y coordinate from ) - if it is a point which is part of a line
   - whateverToCX (Y coordinate to )     - if it is a point which is part of a line


* Flutter beginner: Experimenting with Flutter using Flutter Charts

This section describes, very briefly with links, how to install Flutter, and the Flutter Charts package.

This section We describe running Flutter Charts in development mode on your device (Android, iOS - follow 1, 2 or 3, 4 and 6), or alternatively on a device emulator (device emulator running from an IDE such as IntelliJ with Android Studio installed - follow 1, 2 or 3, 5, 6 or 7).

1. Install Flutter on your computer. See the installation section on https://flutter.io/.
2. Clone flutter_charts code from Github to your computer. Needs git client.
 
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd DIRECTORY_OF_CHOICE
  git clone https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts.git
  # clone will create directory  flutter_charts
  cd flutter_charts
  #+END_SRC

3. (Alternative to 2.): Download and unzip flutter_charts code from Github
   - Browse to  https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts.git
   - On the righ top, click on the "Clone or Download" button, then select save Zip, save and extract to  DIRECTORY_OF_CHOICE
   - cd flutter_charts
4. Prepare a physical device (must be set to Development Mode "On") to run applications from your computer. Then connect a android device in development mode to your computer. See https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android.htm 

5. (Alternative to 4.): Prepare and start an Android device emulator on your computer.
   - Install Android Studio: see https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

   - Install an IDE such as IntelliJ with Flutter plugin. See https://flutter.io/intellij-setup/

6. Run Flutter Charts demo app from command line (this will work in both method 4. and method 5.)

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd DIRECTORY_OF_CHOICE/flutter_charts 
   flutter run example/lib/main.dart 
   #+END_SRC

7. (Alternative to 6.) Run  Flutter Charts demo app from IDE. This will work only with method 5. 
  - Start IntelliJ IDE, create a project in the ~DIRECTORY_OF_CHOICE/flutter_charts~ start an Android emulator, then click on the Run button in Intellij (which should show the ~file:../../../example/lib/main.dart~ in the run button).
