This directory,

flutter_charts/tool

Should contain private tools such as shell scripts to build something or run tests.

From https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-layout#internal-tools-and-scripts :

Mature packages often have little helper scripts and programs that people run while developing the package itself. Think things like test runners, documentation generators, or other bits of automation.

Unlike the scripts in bin, these are not for external users of the package. If you have any of these, place them in a directory called tool.
