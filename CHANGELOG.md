# version 0.3.0 (??)

- API changes
  - Removed the container parameter from the constructor of VerticalBarChart, LineChart.
    For VerticalBarChart:
    ```dart
      VerticalBarChart({
        widgets.Key? key,
        required bar_painter.VerticalBarChartPainter painter,
        widgets.CustomPainter? foregroundPainter,
        widgets.Size size: widgets.Size.zero,
        widgets.Widget? child,
        // REMOVED  required bar_containers.VerticalBarChartContainer container,
        }) : super(
          key: key,
          painter: painter,
          foregroundPainter: foregroundPainter,
          size: size,
          child: child,
        );
    ```
    - If you passed the container before, remove it. 
    - The container is stored on the VerticalBarChartPainter and used from there.
    - A similar situation for the LineChart.

## Enhancements

### Making the codebase Dart 2 clean

Made changes to remove any analyser messages with Dart 2.

### *Labels auto layout* - added pluggable and automated ability to ensure that labels "fit", and do not overlap
 
This release added the ability to "iteratively auto layout" labels. 

Labels auto layout is a sequence of steps, such as skipping some labels, tilting labels, or decreasing label font, that result in label 'fit' nicely, readably, without overflowing or running into each other.

The ability to auto layout labels is implemented using a pluggable base class `LabelLayoutStrategy`, and a concrete implemented extension `DefaultIterativeLabelLayoutStrategy`. This default implementation of the iterative auto layout achieves that labels, defines a zero or more sequences of steps,
each performing a specific code to achieve labels fit, such as:
- Skipping every 2nd label
- Tilting all labels
- Decreasing label font size

The term "iterative" in  "iteratively auto layout" refers to the fact the  `LabelLayoutStrategy` repeates the layout steps multiple times, until a good fit is achieved.

The  `LabelLayoutStrategy` and extensions, including the default `DefaultIterativeLabelLayoutStrategy`, are members of containers which implement the `AdjustableContent`, or extend the abstract `AdjustableContentChartAreaContainer`. The term "adjustable content" here refers to ability to adjust sizes of child components, or even remove child components which would overlap in default conditions (sizes, and mumbers). See usages of `_xContainerLabelLayoutStrategy` in the sample app `example/lib/main.dart` for an example how to use custom `LabelLayoutStrategy` extensions. In practice, `AdjustableContent` is only used for multiple potentially overlaping labels. This knowledge is not necessary for most users who are merely using the default (not built in) iterative auto layout provided by the  `AdjustableContentChartAreaContainer`.

To learn more about the new auto layout process, see the [README.md](README.md) section "Illustration of the new "iterative auto layout" feature".

### Graceful skipping of legend

This release added the ability to skip the legend, when there is insufficient horizontal space. 

## Fixes

### Fixed a bug reported by Lorenzo Tejera, using this data

``` dart
  void defineOptionsAndData() {
    _lineChartOptions = new LineChartOptions();
    _verticalBarChartOptions = new VerticalBarChartOptions();
    _chartData = new ChartData();
    _chartData.dataRowsLegends = [
      "Spring",
      "Summer"
    ];
    _chartData.dataRows = [
      [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
      [4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0]
    ];
    _chartData.xLabels = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"];
    _chartData.assignDataRowsDefaultColors();
    // Note: ChartOptions.useUserProvidedYLabels default is still used (false);
  }
```

Reason: This code - revisit when removing need for double data

``` dart
        if (signMax <= 0) {
          from = min;
          to = 0.0; // was 0, caused issues in Interval typed as double.
        } else {
          from = 0.0;// was 0, caused issues in Interval typed as double.
          to = max;
        }
```

# v0.1.7 (2017-12-17)

Fixed README.md error - images failing to show (https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/issues/8)

# v0.1.6 (2017-12-03)

## Implemented change in https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/issues/5  - allows to set paint on line chart hotspot circles
Added the following new line chart options in `charts/line/options.dart`
``` dart
  ui.Paint hotspotInnerPaint = new ui.Paint()
    ..color = material.Colors.yellow;

  ui.Paint hotspotOuterPaint = new ui.Paint()
    ..color = material.Colors.black;

  double lineStrokeWidth = 3.0;
```

## Implemented change in https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/issues/6 - line chart allows to reverse order of data series (`dataRows`) to make the significant series line to be on top 
Added the following new chart options in `charts/options.dart`

``` dart
  bool firstDataRowPaintedFirst = true;
``` 

## Made several text options configurable

Moved the following to options in `charts/options.dart` (from being hardcoded)

``` dart
  painting.TextStyle labelTextStyle = new painting.TextStyle(
    color: material.Colors.grey[600],
    fontSize: 14.0,);

  ui.TextDirection labelTextDirection   = ui.TextDirection.ltr;
  ui.TextAlign     labelTextAlign       = ui.TextAlign.center;
  double           labelTextScaleFactor = 1.0;
```

## Renamed option `xTopMinTicksHeight` to `xTopPaddingAboveTicksHeight`
New name reflects the usage better.

# v0.1.5 (2017-10-27)

This version finally fixed issue https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts/issues/2 - flutter charts not actually working as a library package (reason: incorrectly specified dependencies).
# v0.1.4 (2017-10-27)

- Only changes in documentation. Also publishing using `flutter packages pub publish` instead of previously incorrect `pub publish` which resulted in a package that reports error on clients' getting the package using `flutter pub get`. Hopefully this change will fix the issue. Below is the full error this new version is trying to fix:

The following log is from a test app in https://github.com/mzimmerm/flutter_charts_sample_app. It is mostly relevant as a documentation of the issue, client apps can ignore this.
