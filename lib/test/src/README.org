This directory

~flutter_charts/test/src~

has subdirectory structure equivalent to

~flutter_charts/lib/src~

and contains classes used only in tests, but are not test classes.

Most it's classes are testing extensions of base classes; those testing extensions are used in tests and integration tests.

Note:

The subdirectory ~flutter_charts/test/src/example~ is not equivalently placed; it contains the main example used in tests.

The intent of this ~example~ subdirectory is to hold a ~main.dart~ used in tests and integration tests,
while the ~flutter_charts/example~ is used to be published on *pub*.
